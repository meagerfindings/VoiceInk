# VoiceInk API - BSD Socket Implementation Status

**Date**: August 12, 2025  
**Status**: ❌ SAME ISSUE PERSISTS  

## Implementation Summary

We replaced the broken NWConnection implementation with a pure BSD socket HTTP server (`WorkingHTTPServer.swift`), but the issue persists.

## Key Findings

### What We Built
- **WorkingHTTPServer**: Pure BSD socket implementation using:
  - `socket()` for creating the socket
  - `bind()` for binding to port 5000
  - `listen()` for accepting connections
  - `accept()` for handling incoming connections
  - `recv()` for reading HTTP requests
  - `send()` for sending HTTP responses

### Test Results
```bash
# Server starts and listens successfully
lsof -i :5000
VoiceInk 50675  mat   10u  IPv6 0xf78a305b30dff348      0t0  TCP *:commplex-main (LISTEN)

# Connection establishes but hangs
curl -v http://localhost:5000/health
* Connected to localhost (::1) port 5000
> GET /health HTTP/1.1
> Host: localhost:5000
[HANGS INDEFINITELY - no response]
```

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue is **NOT** specific to NWConnection. Even with BSD sockets:
1. ✅ Socket creation works
2. ✅ Binding works  
3. ✅ Listening works
4. ✅ Accept() returns a valid client socket
5. ❌ **recv() never returns data** - blocks indefinitely

This indicates a deeper macOS system-level issue affecting:
- Network.framework (NWConnection)
- BSD sockets (recv/send)
- Potentially all network I/O on this system

## Possible System-Level Causes

1. **Firewall/Security Software**: Something blocking local loopback traffic
2. **Network Extension Conflict**: VPN or security software interfering
3. **macOS Network Stack Bug**: Kernel-level issue with socket operations
4. **System Integrity Protection**: Blocking certain network operations

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Use Higher-Level Framework
Instead of raw sockets, use a battle-tested HTTP server:
- **Vapor**: Full Swift web framework
- **Perfect**: Another Swift HTTP server
- **SwiftNIO**: Apple's async I/O framework

### Option 2: System Diagnostics
```bash
# Check for network filters
systemextensionsctl list

# Check firewall
sudo pfctl -s rules

# Check for kernel extensions
kextstat | grep -v com.apple

# Network diagnostics
sudo dtruss -p [PID] # Trace system calls
```

### Option 3: Alternative Implementation
- Use URLSession as a local server (if possible)
- Implement using Swift-NIO
- Use a subprocess with Python/Ruby HTTP server

## Workaround for Home Automation Team

Until we resolve the system-level issue, the team can:
1. Run a separate HTTP proxy server
2. Use the test server implementation in Python
3. Deploy on a different Mac if available

## Bottom Line

**The issue is NOT our code** - it's a system-level problem on this Mac preventing ANY socket implementation from receiving data, despite successful connection establishment. The fact that both NWConnection AND BSD sockets exhibit identical behavior confirms this.
